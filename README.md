Hello this is Julien Mazur. I may be one person you seen before. but that one wierd kid at the back of the class. the one the looks busy. lives in thier moments. surround myself in my passions. someone that no one ever talks too. and everyone who did doesnt. you took the time to try to understand me a bit better. and i appreciate that; programming takes me somewhere. programming is a huge toolbox and the right handyman with the right choices and decisions with the bells and whistles when faced with problems ahead. a good programmer is a good decision maker. their enviorment may never be a only factor for a programmers efficency. sometimes people set up better toolboxes to do the job the right way. programming usually works well with people who are well-rounded and have tested their capabilities at a early age and never gave up trying things out. and overtime a mind that can be more capable with the complexitities of programming since it involves a great deal of conditions, objects, entities, methods, assemblies, solutions, classes, contents, libraries, and add-ins. a good programmer understands buisness. and thats how some of the best people are running their huge tech companies
